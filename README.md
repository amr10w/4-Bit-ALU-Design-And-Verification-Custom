# 4 Bit ALU Design & Verification throw Semi Custom & Full Custom

This project implements a custom Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL, supporting both arithmetic and logical operations. The design includes:

- Verilog RTL code and testbenches

- Schematic designs at the logic gate and transistor level

- Simulation waveforms for functional verification

The ALU is explored through multiple design methodologies:

- Full-custom design using 130 nm technology

- Semi-custom design 

- FPGA implementation (for real-time hardware deployment)

All modules have been verified through simulation, making this a comprehensive ALU design and verification project.
